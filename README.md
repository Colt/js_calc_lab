# Calculator

`git clone` this repo to start the calculator homework.

You can open `calculator.html` to see the (nonfunctional) calculator page.
You're gonna make it work!

1. `calculator.js` is provided and linked to the page for you, but it's blank,
what's the first thing you write? (Without it, your JS won't be able to find any HTML elements on the page---why?)
2. Once you're able to get the elements on the page, you want to know about
clicks to the buttons. How can you listen to `click` events on all the buttons? For debugging purposes, stary by making sure you can log some data to the console whenever a button is clicked.
3. Great, now you know when clicks happen. What do you want to do when a user clicks a button? Do you want a number to display? Update the operator display? Clear a display? The answer to each of those is "sometimes", right? When, then? How doyou decide what to do?
